### Quick Start:

To run the precompiled application, run the following command in the root project directory:

```
bash run.sh
```

Alternatively, run the jar file directly:

```
java -jar kemu-kupu-0.3.0-alpha1.jar
```

### Dependencies:

- JDK / JRE version 11 - 16 (must be compatible with Gradle 6.8.3). 
  
  _NB: You can check your java runtime version by running `java --version`. This should be between 11 and 16._


### Development:

To run the application in development tool, run the command:
- Windows: `gradlew.bat run`
- Other: `./gradlew run`

This will automatically download the JavaFX dependencies (as well as other build tool dependencies) for you to run the application, and this should launch automatically.

### Build:

To build a standalone executable jar application that is "double-clickable", run the command:
- Windows: `gradlew.bat standaloneJar`
- Unix: `./gradlew standaloneJar`

The built `.jar` file will be located under `build/libs/kemu-kupu-<VERSION>.jar`
