# Colour Profiles
In order to support users with colour blindness, KÄ“mu Kupu supports alternate
colour profiles. These colour profiles will be applied to the Scene and can
be used from CSS by any element within the scene. See the 'looked-up colors'
section of the JavaFX CSS Reference for more information:

## Palette Choice
The "IBM Color Blind Safe Palette" is considered a safe choice for people with
deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.
