## 17 September
Implemented a text-to-speech queuing system using Festival. This mainly
resides in a class called `SpeechManager`, and uses the JavaFX Task API
along with an `ExecutorService` in order to run festival in the background.

The idea behind this system was to make each queued 'phrase' (where a phrase
is some text to be said) into a self-contained task, and run these tasks
sequentially. This should result in no phrases overlapping with each other,
as one task must be completely done before another can start.

One issue I encountered was that tasks were running indefinitely. The solution
to this was straightforward (festival needed to be run in batch mode rather
than interactive mode, by supplying the flag '-b'). However, it exposed a flaw
in that is festival were to hang for some reason, it would 'take the rest of the
program' down with it. This is what led me to adding timeouts and comprehensive
exception handling to make the SpeechManager recoverable and robust.

Another feature I wanted was the ability to clear the queue at any point in time,
finishing only the current task and then stopping. While I initially used the
`ExecutorService.shutdown()` method, this was more of a hack than a robust solution
as the ExecutorService would need to be recreated from scratch to submit more
tasks.

My solution was to instead create the queue independently (I used a LinkedBlockingQueue
as this is what the single threaded executor uses according to Java docs) and then
manually constructed a ThreadPoolExecutor with only one thread. I could now clear
the queue independently of the executor in a thread-safe manner.

One 'bonus' feature I added was the ability for the task to set a status message (either
'Running', 'Cancelled', 'Failure', or 'Success') depending on various factors such as
the exit code from the festival process or whether the thread is interrupted. This mainly
helped with debugging and testing the task implementation.

The last feature I attempted was to add playback speed variability. This is accomplished
through the 'Duration_Stretch' property in festival which slows down the playback
accordingly. As the notion of 'stretch' is opposite to 'speed', I took the reciprocal of
the provided speed value to find the stretch multiplier. This is done on a per-task
basis, however it might be worth having some kind of global 'default speed' setting.

I am quite happy with the result overall. The SpeechManager class is robust and
very fast, and meets the required goals of supporting task queuing and the clearing
of said queue. Additionally, I was able to implement speed variability in a fairly
unobtrusive manner.

## 18 September
Fixed some minor issues (primarily related to code style) after feedback from teammates. Had
a team meeting and delegated the next round of tasks (see [minutes](minutes-18-09-21.md)).

## 20 September
Add support for Inter font family. The font 'Inter' is a sans-serif font focused on user-interfaces,
emphasising readability. It is a good fit for Kemu Kupu. The font is added using the FontResource
system designed by Raymond - my teammate. The default font is set to 'Inter 11' using CSS. I have added
all 19 styles of Inter for the meantime, but this can be reduced when we are confident certain styles will
not be used.

I also added some simple styling to the main menu, colouring it a turquoise blue and adding
white-outlined buttons that mostly reflect the initial design. There are no animations, transitions,
or hover/focus states implemented at this time.
